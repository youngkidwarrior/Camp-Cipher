## Summary:
	+ Camp Cipher is a social music website where artists are encouraged to build off one another's work in order to create an environment where good flow and potent lyricis stand out. Users are allowed to "start a campfire" by contributing their best single or four-bar rhyme scheme. A "campfire circle" is then opened up to the public to allow other artists to join in and post their own additions to the freestyle session, where it was left off. These additions can be voted on by other users in the campfire, and the highest voted will be featured under the original posters lyrics. The original poster can also choose his/her original post or an addition to be the hook and will subsequently be featured at the top of the page. All contributions to the site are saved in a user profile for you and are open for later review.
